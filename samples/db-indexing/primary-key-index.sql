 * Non_unique: If the value is 1, the index is not unique, if the value is 0, the index is unique.
 * Key_name: The name of the index created. The name of the primary index is always PRIMARY in MySQL, irrespective of if you have provided any index name or not while creating the index.
 * Seq_in_index: The sequence number of the column in the index. If multiple columns are part of the index, the sequence number will be assigned based on how the columns were ordered during the index creation time. Sequence number starts from 1.
 * Collation: How the column is sorted in the index. A means ascending, D means descending, NULL means not sorted.
 * Cardinality: The estimated number of unique values in the index. More cardinality means higher chances that the query optimizer will pick the index for queries.
 * Sub_part : The index prefix. It is NULL if the entire column is indexed. Otherwise, it shows the number of indexed bytes in case the column is partially indexed.
 * Packed: Indicates how the key is packed; NULL if it is not.
 * Null: YES if the column may contain NULL values and blank if it does not.
 * Index_type: Indicates which indexing data structure is used for this index. Some possible candidates are â€” BTREE, HASH, RTREE, or FULLTEXT.
 * Comment: The information about the index not described in its own column.
 * Index_comment: The comment for the index specified when you created the index with the COMMENT attribute.
